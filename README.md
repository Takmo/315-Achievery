# Achievery

This is the tale of achievery of a student in CSCE 315.

Haha, this is actually the first assignment in CSCE 315 - Section 502.

This is a magical "achievement tracker" that follows specifications as
defined [on the course website]
(http://ecologylab.net/courses/programmingStudio/assignments/individual1.html).

Please do not copy this for your project. See
[Aggie Honor Code](http://student-rules.tamu.edu/aggiecode) and

Not sure why you might want to, but feel free to use this as you want.
